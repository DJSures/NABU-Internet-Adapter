# NABU-Internet-Adapter
Experience NABU as intended with the NABU Internet Adapter software - including Homebrew channels, Retro On-Line chat, Cloud CP/M, and more! DJ Sures created the NABU Internet adapter as a software replacement for the Nabu Network Adapter (NA). The NA was a hardware component connected to the Television Coax Cable and NABU PC. It would decode digital information from the analog cable and send it to the Nabu computer. The NABU Internet Adapter is a command-line application that emulates the NABU Network Adapter and Servers, which provide entertainment and family software to the NABU Personal Computers.

# Issues
For the time being, report NABU Internet Adapter issues here. Read troubleshooting on https://nabu.ca first.

## Issue Reporting Rules

- Read troubleshooting first: https://nabu.ca/nabu-internet-adapter-downloads

- If you are having communicaton issues on a Linux OS, that is most likely due to the baudrate being too fast (115,200) for the little 3mhz cpu and "slightly" near the end of band for the standard baudrate of the NABU's TR88. This is a bug with .NET framework and it has been reported, they're working on it. This is documented numerous times on https://nabu.ca. I cannot help you with that. If you try it on Windows, and it works, but doesn't work in Linux, that's the reason. Or, it's your cable.

- Any issues that are assumed to be user error or due to a bad cable will be ignored. For example, it works in mame but not on your real hardware, due to timeouts or communication errors. For communication errors, fix your cable, or do not use a usb hub.

- If you are complaining that Win 7, Win Vista, Win XP or Windows 3.1 is not supported, your message will be ignored.

- Report your Internet Adapter version in the issue description, or your message will be ignored.

- If your Internet Adapter version is not the most recent, your message will be ignored

- If you do not provide enough information about the issue, and steps you have attempted to remedy the issue, your message will be ignored

- If you have issues with these rules, your message will be ignored ;)


# Disclaimer
I am doing this project for fun to enjoy the NABU PC and participate in growing a NABU community. I certainly am not NABU technical support and I prioritize conversations about NABU developments and ideas. There is a large community growing around the NABU and many other experts who can help diagnost issues. You can log an issue here, and I will check it to see if there's anything I can fix - but I am not technical support for NABU. Soon as this stops being fun, I will move onto another project; So please respect my time and effort. Happy NABU-ing!

If you see me in a chat, or comment on my YouTube channel, try engaging a real conversation with me and not immediately asking me to help you fix something.
